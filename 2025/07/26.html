<article><img src=1753502905.jpg><h2>2025/07/26</h2><p>i think the best advice i've gotten over the past few years is 'eat your veg'. imo, the move fast and break things mentality of the 00's fucked up the way we relate with learning. Speaking personaly, there is so much focus on just getting somehing out there that it's now a point of pride to not understand how it works. for me, this manafest as being suck watching tuts. on youtube as apposed to sitting down, reading a book, and doing my own projects. Learning is one of the best things you can do to better your life but doing it propperly takes time. Slow down and eat your veg, have a compleate meal.</p></article>
