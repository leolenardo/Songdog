<article><img src=1760634854.jpg><h2>2025/10/16</h2><p><p>I've been thinking about <a url ='https://maia.crimew.gay/posts/please/'> this blog post from Maia.</a> During the late 2000's and 2010's, there was a big push for every computer nerd to go to school for 'something IT related'. Teachers, parents, and some of our peers saw it as a sure bet coming out of a economic disaster that devastated the trades as well as some white collar jobs. I've always thought CS was neat but I never wanted to go to school for it and I'm not going to knock anyone who did/does. Some of my closet friends are CS majors. </p>
<p>The problem I have with CS programs is the way they strip away folks ability to hack a project together. Maby I'm just getting older but it feels like there is a lot of fear of learning new things about computers. I was talking to a coworker about implementing a script to automate file management.  They are a pretty smart person and went to school for CS but thought scripting something like this would take too much time and they wouldn't know where to start and they only work with lighting controllers and they don't want to mess something up. Another person refused to set up an emulator for similar reasons.</p>
<p>IDK i guess i wish that people would start doing the projects they Liked on twitter or found on Youtube. This <a url ='coyote.pictures'>
