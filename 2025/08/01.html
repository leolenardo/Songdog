<article><img src=1754054213.jpg><h2>2025/08/01</h2><p>i just finished up my last gig in Atlanta for a while. There are a lot to like about the city. There is so much art here. Everyone is eager to talk about the music they are making or their latest short film. Other citys like Nashville or Savanah have a similar vibe to them, but Atlanta art is embued with a cirtan <i>southern hospatality</i>. Jazz learned on Fake Books, played on stolen keyboards, FL cracks, 808s with no time for heartbreak all heard through your apartment walls.</p> <p> i have'nt lived in or realy near Atlanta for a wille, work <s>keeps</s> kept me there for most of my week for the last few years. i don't have any interest in living in or near Atlanta any time soon. For starters, i don't think i can afford to live there. Rent is crazy and pay in the city for the work that i enjoy doing has stayed pretty stagnant. Many folks work 2 gigs to pay bills. Everyone sells some kind of dope.</p></article>
