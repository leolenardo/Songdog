<article><img src=1742783956.jpg><h2>2025/03/23</h2><p>been thinking a lot about travle. When i was younger my family moved yearly. When we moved to REDACTED and stayed here for a while i felt that their was something that i was missing year after year. i don't <i> love </i> the process of moving, the whole process is super stressful and cost sooo much damn money. But there is someting nice about being to be a new persion again every once and a wile.</p></article>
