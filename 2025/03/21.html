<article><img src=1742580238.jpg><h2>2025/03/21</h2><p>i've been wanting to get out hikeing again. When i was <strikethrough>unemployed</strikethough> between jobs, i started makeing an effort to get outside more. my flexable secedule ment i could hit the trail whenever one of my freinds got a day off ( diden't like going to parks by myself ). Now that i'm working more regularly, that time is getting a lot harder to find. i suppose it's time to start making time.</p></article>
