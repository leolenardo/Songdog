When i was <strikethrough>unemployed</strikethough> between jobs, i started makeing an effort to get outside more. my flexable secedule ment i could hit the trail whenever one of my freinds got a day off ( diden't like going to parks by myself ). Now that i'm working more regularly, that time is getting a lot harder to find. i suppose it's time to start making time.</p></article>

In the next few weeks i'm planning on working on a basic manga scraper ( RIP tachiyomi ) that i can embed into a  <a href =https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo>discord bot</a>. i think the end goal of this would be to have a local version of every book requested, building my own <a href = https://annas-archive.org>shadow library</a> for me and my freinds. Baby steps till then tho.</p></article>

The way hustle culture has invaded almost every aspect of us/american life really brings me down. When telling folks about the art and programing work that i do, the topic of monitazation tends to come up. i have no poroblem with people making a living off of their work, but the idea of 'grinding' does not sound fulfilling.</p></article>
