Back when i was in collage i had a professer introduce to what was book.zz which later became the <a href= https://z-library.sk/> z library</a> and from there i spun off into searching for more of these undergroudnd book sites. The concept of a dark library; a place filled with limitless informaton is so cool to me. As someone that has trouble focusing on the same thing for too long, the abality to endlessly start new books allowed me to get through more than i could <a href= https://libbyapp.com/>at my local librairy</a>. There is also a preservation argument for shadow libs but i wont get into that here. If your a looking for a new site i recomend <a href= https://annas-archive.org/> for the clear net and the Z-lib if you're already useing tor</p></article>
