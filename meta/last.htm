When i was <strikethrough>unemployed</strikethough> between jobs, i started makeing an effort to get outside more. my flexable secedule ment i could hit the trail whenever one of my freinds got a day off ( diden't like going to parks by myself ). Now that i'm working more regularly, that time is getting a lot harder to find. i suppose it's time to start making time.</p></article>
