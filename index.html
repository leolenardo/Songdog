<html><article><a href='2025/03/25.html'><img src=2025/03/1742958756.jpg></a><h2>2025/03/25</h2><p>i see a lot of graff on my way to shows. All sorts of folks leaving their tracks on the forrest floor, awaiting layers plaster to cover them, or a powersprayer to wash them away.</p></article>
<article><a href='2025/03/24.html'><img src=2025/03/1742873385.jpg></a><h2>2025/03/24</h2><p>i think a lot about <a href= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_library>shadow libs</a>. Back when i was in collage i had a professer introduce to what was book.zz which later became the <a href= https://z-library.sk/> z library</a> and from there i spun off into searching for more of these undergroudnd book sites. The concept of a dark library; a place filled with limitless informaton is so cool to me. As someone that has trouble focusing on the same thing for too long, the abality to endlessly start new books allowed me to get through more than i could <a href= https://libbyapp.com/>at my local librairy</a>. There is also a preservation argument for shadow libs but i wont get into that here. If your a looking for a new site i recomend <a href= https://annas-archive.org/> for the clear net and the Z-lib if you're already useing tor</p></article>
<article><a href='2025/03/23.html'><img src=2025/03/1742783956.jpg></a><h2>2025/03/23</h2><p>been thinking a lot about travle. When i was younger my family moved yearly. When we moved to REDACTED and stayed here for a while i felt that their was something that i was missing year after year. i don't <i> love </i> the process of moving, the whole process is super stressful and cost sooo much damn money. But there is someting nice about being to be a new persion again every once and a wile.</p></article>
<article><a href='2025/03/22.html'><img src=2025/03/1742682625.jpg></a><h2>2025/03/22</h2><p>i got a basic webscraper up and running. Right now it has a super limited scope but im working on it. Iterating has been fun, i'm trying to take the time and add comments if only for my own sake later.</p></article>
<article><a href='2025/03/21.html'><img src=2025/03/1742580238.jpg></a><h2>2025/03/21</h2><p>i've been wanting to get out hikeing again. When i was <strikethrough>unemployed</strikethough> between jobs, i started makeing an effort to get outside more. my flexable secedule ment i could hit the trail whenever one of my freinds got a day off ( diden't like going to parks by myself ). Now that i'm working more regularly, that time is getting a lot harder to find. i suppose it's time to start making time.</p></article>
<article><a href='2025/03/20.html'><img src=2025/03/1742516976.jpg></a><h2>2025/03/20</h2><p>ive been picking up <a href=https://golang.google.cn/>go</a> and its been fun! Using the <a href = https://github.com/gocolly/colly>colly</a> framework clicks with my brain in a way that python's <a href= https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>Beautiful Soup</a>. In the next few weeks i'm planning on working on a basic manga scraper ( RIP tachiyomi ) that i can embed into a  <a href =https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo>discord bot</a>. i think the end goal of this would be to have a local version of every book requested, building my own <a href = https://annas-archive.org>shadow library</a> for me and my freinds. Baby steps till then tho.</p></article>
<article><a href='2025/03/19.html'><img src=2025/03/1742386093.jpg></a><h2>2025/03/19</h2><p>Everyone should try camping at least a few times.</p></article>
<article><a href='2025/03/18.html'><img src=2025/03/1742302671.jpg></a><h2>2025/03/18</h2><p>I don't know how everyone got themselves in such a damn hurry. The way hustle culture has invaded almost every aspect of us/american life really brings me down. When telling folks about the art and programing work that i do, the topic of monitazation tends to come up. i have no poroblem with people making a living off of their work, but the idea of 'grinding' does not sound fulfilling.</p></article>
